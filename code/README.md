# Code Folder

The `code` folder contains several Jupyter notebooks for various aspects of diabetic retinopathy detection using image classification models.

## Files

- `Image_Classification.ipynb`: Notebook for general image classification tasks.
- `SDP_Balanced-Dataset_Predifined-Models.ipynb`: Notebook using predefined models on a balanced dataset.
- `SDP_Unbalanced-Dataset_Predifined-Models.ipynb`: Notebook using predefined models on an unbalanced dataset.
- `SDP_CNN_Balanced.ipynb`: Notebook implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on a balanced dataset.
- `SDP_CNN_Unbalanced.ipynb`: Notebook implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on an unbalanced dataset.

These notebooks cover different approaches and models for detecting diabetic retinopathy, each tailored for specific dataset characteristics and model configurations.

## Usage

Each notebook provides detailed explanations, code, and results related to its specific topic. They serve as valuable resources for understanding and implementing machine learning techniques in diabetic retinopathy detection.
