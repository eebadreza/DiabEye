# Pretrained Models Folder

The `pretrained_models` folder contains pretrained models used in diabetic retinopathy detection, organized into two subfolders: `B` (Balanced Dataset) and `UB` (Unbalanced Dataset).

## Folder Contents

### B (Balanced Dataset)

This folder contains pretrained models trained on a balanced dataset, which is suitable for scenarios where each class of diabetic retinopathy has approximately equal representation.

### UB (Unbalanced Dataset)

This folder contains pretrained models trained on an unbalanced dataset, where some classes of diabetic retinopathy may have more samples than others.

## Note

Due to size limitations, only the model used in the web app has been included in this repository. You can run the code files (`SDP_Balanced-Dataset_Predifined-Models.ipynb`, `SDP_Unbalanced-Dataset_Predifined-Models.ipynb`, etc.) to generate and save additional models for both balanced and unbalanced datasets.

## Usage

These pretrained models can be used for inference and evaluation of diabetic retinopathy detection models. They were trained using the code files provided in the `code` folder, leveraging various machine learning techniques such as predefined models and convolutional neural networks.
