## About the Project

The Diabetic Retinopathy Detection App leverages advanced image classification techniques to identify signs of diabetic retinopathy in retinal images. The application aims to provide an accessible and efficient tool for early detection, aiding in timely medical intervention.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `app`: Contains the code for the web application.
- `code`: Notebooks for model training and image classification.
- `images/val`: Images used for validation purposes.
- `pretrained_models`: Folder containing models trained using the notebooks in the `code` folder.
- `reference`: Reference notebooks and testing scripts.

### app

The `app` folder contains the code for the Streamlit web application. This includes scripts to run the app, manage user input, and display predictions.

### code

The `code` folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for model training and image classification. These notebooks include data preprocessing, model architecture, training routines, and evaluation metrics.

### images/val

The `images/val` folder holds the images used for validation. These images are used to test the performance and accuracy of the trained models.

### pretrained_models

The `pretrained_models` folder contains the models that were trained using the notebooks in the `code` folder. These models can be loaded and used by the app for making predictions.

### reference

The `reference` folder includes additional notebooks and testing scripts that provide further context and validation for the project. These are useful for understanding the development and testing process.

## Getting Started
