# Validation Folder

The `validation` folder contains images categorized into 5 classes for validating diabetic retinopathy detection models.

## Classes

The images are organized into the following classes:

- **Mild:** Images showing mild diabetic retinopathy.
- **Moderate:** Images showing moderate diabetic retinopathy.
- **Severe:** Images showing severe diabetic retinopathy.
- **Proliferate:** Images showing proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
- **NO_DR:** Images showing no signs of diabetic retinopathy.

Each class folder contains images representative of that specific category, aiding in the validation and evaluation of diabetic retinopathy detection models.

## Dataset Information

### Dataset Link

The images in this folder are sourced from the following dataset:

- [Diabetic Retinopathy 224x224 Gaussian Filtered Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sovitrath/diabetic-retinopathy-224x224-gaussian-filtered/data?select=train.csv)

### About the Dataset

This dataset provides preprocessed retinal images categorized into various stages of diabetic retinopathy. It includes images resized to 224x224 pixels and filtered with Gaussian blur for enhanced feature detection.

The dataset is useful for training and validating machine learning models aimed at detecting diabetic retinopathy based on retinal images.
